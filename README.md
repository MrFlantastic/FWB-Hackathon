### tl;dr  
A token gated special guest series where the FWB community PartyBids on crowdsourced speakers for a multimedia live event NFT. A DAO forms around the NFT with creator/speaker interaction. Intimate experience with creators and their community, also allows audience members to not only hold the multimedia NFT as a curative piece, but collectively shape the event itself. WIth simple DAO governance tools, the audience can crowdsource the best questions for the Q&A session, even elect 3rd and 4th chair seats to the most engaged users in the token-gated Discord channel. Gives creators and their fans an experience and canvas to congregate and collaborate. 

### Abstract  
We're excited to introduce For Here<sup>TM</sup> , a special guest speaker series curated by the FWB community. The motivation behind this project is simple, how do we introduce more interesting people and communities to FWB while highlighting and leveraging the existing network and infrastructure FWB provides?  

The schedule of For Here<sup>TM</sup> events will be curated and marketed by minting NFTs on the Zora marketplace to announce future guests. By scheduling and collaboarting with artists beforehand, we can come up with performance KPIs to measure how well they engage with their current audience and bring in capital to the ParyBid (affiliate links, etc.) a signal of interest. This could be an interesting lever experimenting with how to best incentivize creators with larger pools of the initial $ToGo Tokens. These stipulations could certainly be writen into the formation contracts for DAO treasuries:

- _Initial reserve price set:_ 1 ETH (those eager to speak could set the floor as low as 0.1 ETH)
- 

Combining Zora and PartyBid protocols, audiences will be able to come together to collectively bid on an NFT representing a future speaking engagement to incentivize their favorite artists/creators to come and participate with the community in the auction and resulting DAO. If the reserve price is met, ownership of the NFT is passed to the members of this newly formed DAO, where they can join a token-gated Discord channel to interact with the speaker and other event organizers to curate the live event to be structured in the way they want.

The live event will be a conversation between the special guest and the portion of the audience collectively represented as $ToGo token holders of the organizing DAO, some of whom may even be on stage as 3rd chair with Derek, current host of FWB Coffee Time, moderating. After the predetermined time has expired, $ToGo token holders will have acess 


### Pulse Dashboard

This built within the Pulse dashboard, here we can see a snippet of what it would look like during the sourcing stage. We would like to open up to the FWB community for a list of nominees which will be voted on in the Coffee Time channel using a tool similar to Sesh:.  speaker proposal receiving the highest number of votes will be chosen as next month's guest, setting off the marketing operation of this product.

Early partnership with the members of FWB will be critical for this first cohort of guests.

## PartyBid
PartyBid is a protocol that allows a group of internet homies to pool their funds together in order to win an NFT auction.
At the end of the voting period, an NFT representing this future event will be minted on Zora and a PartyBid will be initiated with the intent to purchase it.

## PartyDAO ðŸ¥³
PartyBid is the first product developed by PartyDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that builds and ships products. PartyDAO was [created initially](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) for the purpose of shipping PartyBid.
To keep up with PartyDAO, follow [@prtyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtyDAO) on Twitter and [Mirror](https://party.mirror.xyz/). Acquire 10 [$PARTY tokens](https://etherscan.io/token/0x402eb84d9cb2d6cf66bde9b46d7277d3f4a16b54?a=0x2f4bea4cb44d0956ce4980e76a20a8928e00399a) to join the DAO and party with us.

## Features
- A PartyBid contract is deployed targeting a single NFT auction
- Anyone can contribute ETH to the PartyBid while the auction is still live
- Anyone who has contributed to the PartyBid can trigger a bid on the targeted NFT auction
- After the auction closes, if the PartyBid won the NFT, the token is fractionalized; all contributors whose funds were used to win the auction are rewarded with ERC-20 tokens representing a fractionalized share of the NFT. Tokens are fractionalized using [fractional.art contracts](https://github.com/fractional-company/contracts)
- If a PartyBid wins the NFT, a 5% fee is paid to the PartyDAO multisig 


Once the reserve price is met (covering FWB overhead costs, PartyBid platform fee, speaker fee, etc.), the bid will be placed. If the auction is won, any contributor can return to claim their "$TOGO" tokens, relative to the amount contributed. If the reserve price isn't met, or another DAO collectively outbids the PartyBid, any contributors can return and reclaim the ETH they contributed.  

As previously mentioned, collaboration will be key for the early days of HotTakes. While this crowdfunding mechanism can be a powerful tool to attract guests, it'll be important to have precommited speakers who are willing to participate in the DAO with their excited future audience members.
We would like to open up to the FWB community for a list of nominees which will be voted on in the Coffee Time channel using a tool similar to Sesh:

### The DAO
Token Holders will be able to connect their wallets to join a token-gated Discord server dedicated to their upcoming event. This server will be the first chance token holders will have to interact with each other and their future speaker. Token weighted governance protocols can be used to determine everything from what topics they want to be covered to who else will join their speaker on stage.

### The Event
1-hour long conversation with the speaker of choice and chosen members of the newly formed DAO moderated by Derek. After having a say in structure, topics and questions beforehand, token holders will be shown in "the front row" and have their questions answered first during the Q&A session. During the call, non-token holding attendees will have the opportunity to purchase tokens from a pool set aside by the speaker for any others who missed the PartyBid.  

While hosted on the FWB programming and servers, the event will be run on the Cadenza plaftorm, a new tool which we think has a lot of the functionality needed to stand this project up.

### The Greenroom

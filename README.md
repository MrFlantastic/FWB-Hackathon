###Abstract
We're excited to introduce HotTakes<sup>TM</sup>, a special guest speaker series curated by the FWB community. The motivation behind this project is simple, how do we introduce more interesting people and communities to FWB while highlighting and leveraging the existing network and infrastructure FWB provides?  

Combining Zora and PartyBid protocols, audiences will be able to come together to collectively bid on an NFT to incentivize their favorite artists/creators to come and share their HotTakes with the community. If the reserve price is met, ownership of the NFT is passed to the members of a newly formed DAO where they can interact with the speaker, vote for 2<sup>nd</sup>
